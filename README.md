## Project Overview
The Quantium Data Analytics simulation focuses on analysing retail transaction data to provide insights for a grocery store chain. The primary business problem is understanding customer purchasing patterns and behaviours to optimise store operations, improve product offerings, and drive customer engagement and profitability. The project involves cleaning and analysing large datasets, identifying trends, and making data-driven recommendations to enhance business decisions.

## Objectives
- To identify patterns and relationships between customer types (lifestage and premium status) and their purchasing behaviour.

- To determine high-performing products, stores, and periods.

- To guide marketing and inventory decisions based on transaction and segment trends.

## Problem Statement.
   
The retail brand seeks to understand better its diverse customer base and their buying behaviour to tailor promotions, allocate inventory efficiently, and maximise profitability. However, the current lack of segmentation-driven insights hampers the ability to personalise offerings and prioritise products effectively across stores

- Tailor promotional bundles for premium customers to maximise basket sizes.

2. **Inventory Planning**

- Prioritise high-demand products like "Smiths Crinkle Cut" and "CCs Nacho Cheese" in high-performing stores.

- Investigate and phase out underperforming SKUS with consistently low sales and customer engagement.

3. **Seasonal Campaigns**

- Align campaigns with observed seasonal peaks to capitalise on high foot traffic periods.

- Use historical trends to prepare stock ahead of demand surges.

4. **Loyalty & Retention**

- Leverage loyalty card data to introduce a reward system targeting premium and mainstream customers to enhance retention.
